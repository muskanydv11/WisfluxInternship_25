# Why React?
* We can use state variables, so when a state is updated, the change reflects throughout the page.
* Our app can be divided into reusable components for better structure and reuse.
* React relies on a virtual DOM, which updates the UI more efficiently than traditional DOM manipulation.
* It is easier to debug and maintain code in React.
